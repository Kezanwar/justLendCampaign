# justLendCampaign (WORK IN PROGRESS)

JustLend Coding Task;-

Really enjoyed this one, just feel like ive ran out of time! Had to make some sacrfices due to the timescale that i'll list below:

- Absolutelty 0 responsiveness implemented, literally not one media query unfortunately. This decision was forced because I gave myself too much to do, which resulted in having to spend a large of cunk of build time fleshing out components. As the build commenced I realised I wouldnt be able to get all the sections finished if I spent time configuring responsiveness & the usual debugging that comes along with it. So unfortunately the project will only look as intended on a 13" Macbook Pro using Chrome as thats what ive built it with. An annoying sacrifice to make as i think this project would end up looking real nice across other screen sizes.

- No backend, started the project off using a react/express boiler plate project, ended up splitting it into a fresh create-react-app because i realised i probablky wont ave time to build out the express/mongoDB back end. Also, ive never tried to host a react/express app on firebase, thought it would be better to just stick to what i know with hosting a static site on firebase

- There are a few more things but will discuss in the interview!
