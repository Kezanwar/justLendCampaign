# justLendCampaign (WORK IN PROGRESS)

JustLend Coding Task;-

Unfortunately feel like ive ran out of time, spent near enough all weekend working on it, had some sacrfices due to the timescale that i'll list below:

- Absolutelty 0 responsiveness implemented, literally not one media query unfortunately. This decision was made because I probably gave myself too much to do and ended having to spend a large of cunk of build time fleshing out components otherwise I wouldnt have got all the sections finished if I spent time configuring responsiveness & the usual debugging that comes along with it. So unfortunately the project will only look as intended on a 13" Macbook Pro using Chrome as thats what ive built it with.

- No backend, started the project off using a react/express boiler plate project, ended up splitting it into a fresh create-react-app because i realised i probablky wont ave time to build out the express/mongoDB back end. Also, ive never tried to host a react/express app on firebase, thought it would be better to just stick to what i know with hosting a static site on firebase

- There are a few more things but will discuss in the interview!
