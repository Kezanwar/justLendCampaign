# justLendCampaign (WORK IN PROGRESS)

JustLend Coding Task;-

Unfortunately feel like ive ran out of time, spent near enough all weekend working on it, had some sacrfices due to the timescale that i'll list below:

- Absolutelty 0 responsiveness implemented, literally not one media query unfortunately. This decision was made because I probably gave myself too much to do and ended up spending the whole time building out components, wouldnt have got all the sections finished if i spent time dealing with responsiveness & the debugging that comes along with it.

- No backend, started the project off using a react/express boiler plate project, ended up splitting it into a fresh create-react-app because i realised i probablky wont ave time to build out the express/mongoDB back end and also ive never tried to host a react/express app on firebase, thought it would be better to just stick to what i know with hosting a static site on firebase

- There are a few more things but will discuss in the interview!
